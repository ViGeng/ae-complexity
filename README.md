# Autoencoder Complexity Analysis

## Overview
This project implements experiments to verify whether autoencoders can help identify samples that external classifiers might struggle with. The project explores two complementary hypotheses:

1. Samples with high reconstruction error from an autoencoder (i.e., harder to reconstruct) correlate with samples that are more likely to be misclassified by a separate classifier model.

2. Samples that lie far from their class centroid in the latent space (i.e., on the "edges" of class clusters) are more likely to be misclassified by external classification models.

3. **Relative Distance Ratio Hypothesis**: Samples whose distance to their own class centroid is close to their distance to other class centroids (i.e., samples near decision boundaries) are more likely to be misclassified.

## Hypotheses
1. **Reconstruction Error Hypothesis**: Samples that are "atypical" with respect to the data distribution (as measured by high reconstruction error from an autoencoder) are more likely to be misclassified by external classification models.

2. **Latent Space Distance Hypothesis**: Samples that are farther from their respective class centroids in the autoencoder's latent space (i.e., outliers within their own class) are more likely to be misclassified by external classification models.

3. **Relative Distance Ratio Hypothesis**: Samples whose distance to their own class centroid is close to their distance to other class centroids (i.e., samples near decision boundaries) are more likely to be misclassified.

## Usage

### Basic Execution
Run the experiment with default parameters:
```
python main.py
```

### Customization
Customize the experiment with command-line arguments:
```
python main.py --batch-size 128 --latent-dim 20 --ae-epochs 10 --cls-epochs 8
```

Parameters:
- `--batch-size`: Batch size for training (default: 128)
- `--ae-epochs`: Number of epochs for autoencoder training (default: 10)
- `--cls-epochs`: Number of epochs for classifier training (default: 8)
- `--latent-dim`: Dimension of latent space (default: 20)
- `--distance-metric`: Distance metric to use in latent space (default: 'euclidean', options: 'euclidean', 'cosine')

## Results Interpretation

After running the experiment, you'll find visualization outputs in the `results/` directory and statistical summaries printed to the console. Key metrics to look for:

1. **Accuracy differences**:
   - Between high and low reconstruction error samples
   - Between samples far from vs. close to their class centroids in latent space
   - Between samples with high vs. low relative distance ratios

2. **Correlations**:
   - Between reconstruction error and classifier confidence
   - Between latent space distance and classifier confidence
   - Between relative distance ratio and classifier confidence

3. **Prediction performance**:
   - Precision, recall, and F1 score when using reconstruction error to predict misclassifications
   - Precision, recall, and F1 score when using latent space distance to predict misclassifications
   - Precision, recall, and F1 score when using relative distance ratio to predict misclassifications

If the hypotheses are correct, you should observe:
- Higher misclassification rates for samples with high reconstruction error, samples far from their class centroids, and samples with high relative distance ratios
- Negative correlations between classifier confidence and all three metrics
- Better-than-random performance when using these metrics to identify potential misclassifications

## Key Findings

### Experiment Results Summary

We conducted experiments on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, which provide different levels of complexity:

| Metric | MNIST | CIFAR-10 |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Overall Classification Accuracy | ~98% | 47.2% |
| Reconstruction Error vs Correctness Correlation | -0.16 | -0.016 |
| Absolute Distance vs Correctness Correlation | -0.15 | -0.087 |
| Relative Distance Ratio vs Correctness Correlation | -0.18 | -0.404 |

### MNIST Dataset Results

On the simpler MNIST dataset:
- Samples with high reconstruction error showed lower classification accuracy (87.6%) compared to samples with low reconstruction error (98.6%)
- Samples far from their class centroids had 92.8% accuracy versus 98.6% for samples close to centroids
- Samples with high relative distance ratios achieved 89.4% accuracy versus 99.2% for samples with low ratios
- All metrics showed weak to moderate correlations with misclassification (-0.15 to -0.18)
- The combined approach flagging both high reconstruction error and high relative distance showed promising results for identifying the most challenging samples

### CIFAR-10 Dataset Results

On the more complex CIFAR-10 dataset:
- The overall classification accuracy was much lower (47.2%), providing more misclassifications to analyze
- Reconstruction error showed almost no correlation with classification correctness (-0.016)
- Absolute distance showed weak correlation with correctness (-0.087)
- **Relative distance ratio showed strong correlation with correctness (-0.404)**
- Samples with low relative distance ratio achieved 76.4% accuracy (vs overall 47.2%)
- Samples with high relative distance ratio achieved only 32.7% accuracy
- K-means clustering in latent space achieved only 24.7% accuracy, indicating the challenges of unsupervised approaches on complex datasets

### Key Insights

1. **Different Signals for Different Complexity Levels**:
   - For simple datasets (MNIST), all metrics provide similar weak signals for identifying misclassifications
   - For complex datasets (CIFAR-10), the relative distance ratio emerges as a significantly stronger predictor

2. **Relative Distance Ratio is Most Effective**:
   - Across both datasets, the ratio of distance-to-own-class versus distance-to-other-classes consistently provided the strongest signal
   - On CIFAR-10, samples with low relative distance ratios achieved 76.4% accuracy (29.2 percentage points higher than average)

3. **Reconstruction Error Diminishes with Complexity**:
   - While effective for simpler datasets like MNIST, reconstruction error becomes much less informative as dataset complexity increases
   - This suggests that for complex tasks, the geometric relationships in latent space are more important than reconstruction capability

4. **Practical Applications**:
   - These metrics, especially relative distance ratio, can effectively identify samples that are likely to be misclassified
   - This could enable targeted human review of high-risk predictions or guide active learning strategies
   - The methods work without needing ground truth labels during inference time

## Conclusion

Our experiments provide strong evidence that autoencoder-derived metrics can identify samples that are likely to be misclassified by external models. The relative distance ratio emerged as the most powerful and consistent predictor across datasets of varying complexity.

For real-world applications dealing with complex data, focusing on the geometric relationships in latent space (particularly the relative distance ratio) offers a promising approach to confidence estimation and uncertainty quantification. This could significantly enhance the reliability of machine learning systems in critical applications by identifying when predictions are likely to be incorrect.

## Future Directions

Potential extensions to this work:
- Test on additional complex datasets beyond CIFAR-10
- Explore different autoencoder architectures (VAEs, denoising autoencoders)
- Combine multiple metrics using ensemble or meta-learning approaches
- Investigate adaptive approaches that learn class-specific distance thresholds
- Use these insights to develop better calibration methods for neural networks
- Implement active learning strategies guided by the relative distance ratio to improve model performance with fewer labeled examples
- Extend to detection of adversarial examples and out-of-distribution samples
